# test dependends on std. The test harness defines its own
# panic implementation. When you run cargo test, cargo doesn't run 
# your program, instead it build a separate binary 
# fn main() {
#   // setup runtime
#   // setup panic handling
#   // discover all #[test] functions
#   // run them
#   // print results to stdout
# }
# This auto-generated binary is called the test harness. Our main is not used
# not the panic handler and entry point (start)
